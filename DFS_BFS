Create a Queue Q
Queue the vertex to Q
mark it v
while(Q is not empty) {
   t = dequeue from Q
   if(t is what we are looking for) {
      return true;
   }
   for edges e(Adjacent Edges Q) {
      u = e->AdjacentVertex;
      if(u is not marked) {
         mark u;
         Queue u to Q
      }
   }   
   return none;
}

DFS:
DFS()
mark v as explored
for edges in v {
  if edge is not explored {
     get all vertex {
        if vertex is not explored {
           e as discovery edge
           run DFS;
        }
        else {
           mark e as backedge
        }
  }
}
